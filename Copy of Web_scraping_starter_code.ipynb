    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the data we're after won't be available via a spreadsheet download, or an API. It might be embedded in a web page, or spread across several web pages. In this case, web scraping can be a good solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a slightly more complicated data acquisition method. It involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grabbing (or 'scraping') the HTML underlying a website\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching (or 'parsing') it to extract the information you're interested in. HTML is a language where different pieces of content on a website are sandwiched or enclosed inside 'tags' that describe exactly what that piece of content is. So, a large heading would be enclosed between opening and closing heading tags: ``<h1> My Heading <\\h1>``. By searching for particular tags in our scraped HTML, we can pick out and store the exact pieces of content we're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is the programmatic equivalent of browsing a website, and copy-pasting content from the website into your own local file or spreadsheet. There are some basic rules to follow when scraping websites, to avoid getting into trouble:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Don't scrape websites that ask you not to scrape them** It's important to avoid scraping websites that explicitly prohibit scrapers/crawlers/spiders/robots (these can sometimes be used to all mean scraping) in their Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions. Under special circumstances, it might be possible to get permission from a website to scrape them if you make direct contact with the owners, explain why you'd like to scrape their site, and what you'll do with the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ask permission** If possible, it's polite/good practise to drop the organisation behind a website a note or email to let them know you'll be scraping their site. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid scraping personal data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Be considerate** Don't send one million requests to a website in the space of one second! If you're looping through several URLs, add in a pause of a second or two using a function like ``time.sleep(5)`` to make sure you don't overwhelm a website's servers.\n",
    "\n",

       "<p>Most of today's Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide <a href=\"/wiki/Boulevard\" title=\"Boulevard\">boulevards</a> laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest's evolution as a city. Budapest's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflecting the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-124\"><a href=\"#cite_note-124\">[124]</a></sup> Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-125\"><a href=\"#cite_note-125\">[125]</a></sup> Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, <a href=\"/wiki/Greater_Budapest\" title=\"Greater Budapest\">Greater Budapest</a> has been divided into 22 <a href=\"/wiki/Borough\" title=\"Borough\">boroughs</a> (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. The city centre itself, in its broadest sense, comprises Districts <b>V, VI, VII, VIII, IX</b><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-126\"><a href=\"#cite_note-126\">[126]</a></sup> and <b>XIII</b> on the Pest side, and <b>I, II, XI</b> and <b>XII</b> on the Buda side of the city.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-127\"><a href=\"#cite_note-127\">[127]</a></sup>\n",
       "</p><p>District I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is also in Buda, in the northwest, and District III stretches along the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to Pest (the eastern side), where it occupies the northernmost point. With District V, another circle begins, located right in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other. District X is another, more external circle, also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No other districts in this circle remain in Buda. We must retrace our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external parts of the city ), lying almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again. District XXI is the extension of the above circle between two branches of the Danube, the northern tip of a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Csepel-sziget\" title=\"Csepel-sziget\">long island</a> south of Budapest. District XXII is still on the same circle in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-128\"><a href=\"#cite_note-128\">[128]</a></sup>\n",
